# The FDE “Ready in Six” Onboarding Program and Capstone Project {#the-fde-“ready-in-six”-onboarding-program-and-capstone-project}

The **FDE Ready in Six (R6) Onboarding Program** is a six-week learning journey designed to build technical expertise, business acumen, and consultative skills. Through a combination of pre-work, immersive onsite sessions, and post-work activities, you will gain the experience and confidence needed to deliver real-world solutions.

At the center of the program is the **Capstone Project**, where small teams design, configure, and deploy an Agentforce solution that addresses a meaningful business challenge. The Capstone is your opportunity to:

* Apply skills developed throughout the program, including AI consulting, Salesforce product knowledge, and stakeholder engagement.  
* Connect your solution to measurable business outcomes and KPIs.  
* Demonstrate a consultative mindset in solving complex challenges.  
* Build agents that are secure, reliable, and production-ready.

**One of the real-world challenges you will practice solving is that only 11% of customers who activate an agent in a sandbox move it into production.** The Capstone gives you the opportunity to build the skills and judgment required to help customers successfully bridge this gap.

### **The Value of This Experience**

Ready in Six is more than a set of activities—it is an integrated development journey. Each part of the program builds toward helping you:

* Translate technical expertise into business impact.  
* Confidently navigate high-stakes customer conversations.  
* Practice building and delivering solutions that drive adoption and success in production environments.

By the end of the program, you will have developed not just knowledge, but the skills, confidence, and consultative approach to deliver meaningful business value.

# Capstone Project Overview & Directions {#capstone-project-overview-&-directions}

You will work in a team of 3–4 to design, configure, and present your Capstone Project. Your final presentation will take the form of a live demonstration delivered to an Evaluation Panel role-playing as a Senior Customer Audience.

Throughout the program, you’ll prepare for this milestone step by step. See the [**Program Timeline**](#capstone-timeline:) in the next section for pacing recommendations and guidance.

As part of your Capstone Project, you will:

1. **Understand the Challenge:**   
* Teams will be assigned a real-world use case and the business case it needs to align to during the onsite. Review the [**use cases below**](?tab=t.cjfzlz9wg6c3) that can be used for the Capstone for details.  
* Establish success criteria and KPIs for the solution to meet those business objectives before designing the solution.  
* Each team will receive a prepared Dev Org (see above) that reflects the scenarios available for assignment.   
2. **Build the Agentforce Solution:**   
   A successful build and delivery demonstrates the capabilities of a Forward Deployed Engineer at Salesforce. This includes:  
* A polished, high-impact solution addressing a strategic business challenge with clear ROI potential.  
* An agent that is well-architected, secure, and reliable—demonstrating advanced API integrations, robust testing, and proactive identification of scenario-specific risks with thoughtful mitigations and safeguards against potential failures or vulnerabilities. At minimum, the agent must include a custom Apex action, custom Flow action, and a prompt template action.  
* A compelling connection between business value and KPIs, with thoughtful guided design, a persuasive business case, and a roadmap tailored for an executive audience.  
* Strong consultative skills reflected in a confident, engaging presentation that inspires confidence in the solution’s transformative impact.  
3. **Identify the Deployment Plan:**   
   * Outline a strategic deployment plan for the agent and any APIs implemented.  
4. **Demonstrate Impact:**   
   * Connect the agent’s architecture and functionality—including APIs and deployment strategies—to key customer KPIs.  
   * Propose performance tracking and optimization strategies via metrics and user feedback.  
   * Summarize how the agent’s architecture and functionality solve business challenges in a **Business Value Statement** or **Brief**.  
5. **Prepare to Present to a Senior Customer Audience:**  
   * Develop a polished demonstration of the Agentforce solution, tailored to the **Senior Customer Audience** with emphasis on strategic impact and business goals.  
   * Be ready to articulate design choices—including API integrations, deployment considerations, testing frameworks, and safety measures—while highlighting the agent’s business value connected to relevant APIs, and your consultative readiness.  
6. **Present to an Evaluation Panel:**   
   * Teams deliver their final Capstone Project onsite on Day 10\.  
   * An Evaluation Panel of up to three evaluators will role-play as the Senior Customer Audience.  
   * Total time: 50 minutes (30–35 minutes for presentation, 15–20 minutes for Q\&A and feedback).  
   * Immediate feedback is provided by the Evaluation Panel to guide next steps and highlight strengths and areas for improvement.  
7. **Receive Results/Feedback**   
   * **Receive feedback** from the Evaluation Panel via Slack in Week 5 (no later than Wednesday) with rubric scores, qualitative feedback, and manager visibility. Align on next steps based on program performance and ES recommendations.  
8. **Hibernate Demo Org:**   
   * Complete only after all Capstone exercises are finished and cleared by the Operations/Evaluation Team.  
   * Use the **Data Cloud Hibernate QBrix** to suspend unnecessary schedules and features, reducing costs and freeing resources.

# Program Evaluation {#program-evaluation}

Your success in the **FDE Ready in Six Onboarding Program** will be evaluated both **individually** and as a **team**.

### **Individual Evaluation**

You are responsible for completing the requirements of each phase of the program:

* **Pre-Work (Weeks 1–2):** Complete all required learning in the [**FDE "Ready in Six" (R6) Pre-Work ACT**](https://readiness.my.site.com/act/share-nav?recordId=a6JHu000000UF3D&type=course) (see [**Program Timeline**](#capstone-timeline:) for details).  
* **Onsite Learning (Weeks 3–4):** Take the **Experience Quiz** (30 questions, 60 minutes to complete) completed on Day 7\. If the quiz is not passed on the first attempt, it can be re-attempted on Day 8\.

### **360 Peer Feedback Survey**

As part of your overall development, you will complete the [**FDE R6 – 360 Peer Feedback Survey**](https://forms.gle/LhYKSsK8nAFJ2j8a6), which enables teammates to provide constructive, example-based feedback on one another’s Capstone contributions.

The survey evaluates Collaboration & Professionalism, Contribution & Role Application, and Communication & Growth Mindset using a 5-point scale.

Feedback is shared with both you and your manager to support growth, reinforce accountability, and uphold our core value of **Trust**.

### **Team Evaluation: The Capstone**

Your team will present your **Capstone Project** to an **Evaluation Panel** role-playing as a Senior Customer Audience.

* **Format:** 50 minutes total — 30–35 minutes to present, 15–20 minutes for Q\&A and feedback.  
* **Scoring:** Teams are scored using the [**Capstone Evaluation Rubric**](#capstone-evaluation-rubric), across six assessment areas.  
* **Team Score:** All members of a team will receive the same overall Capstone score.  
* **Feedback:** After your presentation, the Evaluation Panel will provide targeted feedback to help you identify strengths and opportunities for growth. *Please note: **this session is not where pass/fail is determined**. Final results will be communicated after the panel has finished its full scoring and review process.*

### **What to Expect from the Evaluation Panel**

* Panels are made up of **Delivery SMEs, experienced Salesforce ICs, and Leadership Team**.  
* They will **role-play as the customer** for whom your Agentforce solution was designed.  
* During your session, they will ask challenging questions, provide resistance or curiosity, and test your ability to **showcase business impact** — tying your solution to KPIs, ROI, adoption, and measurable customer outcomes.  
* Afterward, they will give you **direct feedback** on what worked well and what could be improved, along with **next steps** if your team needs to strengthen elements of your solution.

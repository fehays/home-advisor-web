### **1\. Home Furnishing Retailer: Launching an AI-Powered Home Advisor**

* **Company:** A household name in furniture and décor, spanning multiple brands both online and in-store. Known for blending design inspiration with customer convenience, but customer service teams are strained by high volumes and rising expectations.  
* **Scenario:** The company currently relies on traditional customer service channels (e.g., phone, email, basic FAQs) for product inquiries, order status, and initial design guidance. Customer feedback indicates high call volumes, slow response times, and a lack of personalized assistance, leading to customer frustration and missed sales opportunities.  
* **Challenge:** Design, build, and deploy a new Agentforce "*Home Advisor Agent*" to provide instant, accurate, and personalized support, thereby improving customer experience and operational efficiency, and ultimately driving revenue and reducing operational costs.  
* **Short-term Build & Deployment Plan:** Develop a plan to launch the new "Home Advisor Agent" capable of handling product inquiries and order status. The customer’s stated  goal is to deflect 20% of common customer service inquiries from traditional channels and achieve a 90% accuracy rate in responses within the first three months of deployment. The agent must integrate with the product catalog API and maintain session context for at least 30 minutes.  
* **Long-term Agentic Roadmap:** Propose a roadmap to evolve the "*Home Advisor Agent*" into a comprehensive "*Personal Design Consultant*," including capabilities for personalized design recommendations based on user preferences, in-store appointment scheduling, and multi-channel deployment (web, mobile app, voice). This evolution should aim to increase average order value (AOV) for agent-assisted sales and boost customer retention through enhanced personalization.  
* **Relation to Momentum Customers:** This scenario is inspired by **Williams Sonoma** and **Lennar**.  
  * **Williams Sonoma** is a large home furnishing retailer that uses a "Website Service Agent" for various customer service functions, including "WiSMO, Self-Scheduling, Return/Refund Initiation, Split Delivery use cases delivered via website chat across multiple brands". The scenario's focus on a "multi-brand retailer" seeking an AI-powered "Home Advisor Agent" for product inquiries and initial design guidance directly aligns with the type of multi-brand customer service a company like Williams Sonoma would address.  
  * The scenario's mention of "slow response times" and a lack of personalized assistance due to the absence of a robust agentic solution is informed by challenges observed with **Lennar's** existing Lead Management Agent. Lennar experienced "latency of 12-20 sec for knowledge based response" and had issues where the "ASA session ends after 2 hours of inactivity and doesn't hold session context," leading to poor customer experience. A new build for a home furnishing retailer would aim to proactively address these types of performance and context retention issues.
